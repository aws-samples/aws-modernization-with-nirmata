## Next steps

Once you have accessed your AWS account, proceed to the [VS Code Server Setup](../1_aws_event/13_vscode-server.html) section to set up your development environment. The VS Code environment will provide you with all the tools needed to complete this workshop.

After setting up VS Code, you can verify that you can see the pre-deployed EKS cluster and then continue to the [Components setup](../3_components_setup.html) section.
