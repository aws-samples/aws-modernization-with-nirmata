## Operationalizing Governance with Nirmata Workflows

With all three control points implemented, you now have comprehensive policy enforcement across your cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes clusters, and CI/CD pipelines. However, governance isn't just about blocking non-compliant resources - it's also about managing exceptions, handling remediation, and maintaining compliance over time.

### The Governance Lifecycle
Policy enforcement is just one part of a complete governance strategy. Organizations also need processes for:

1. **Exception Management**: Handling legitimate cases where policies need to be bypassed
2. **Remediation Workflows**: Fixing policy violations in a controlled, documented manner
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Demonstrating adherence to internal and external requirements
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Refining policies based on operational feedback

### What You'll Implement
In this section, you'll learn how to:
- Manage compliance across your environment
- Create and approve policy exceptions
- Implement remediation workflows for policy violations

These workflows complete the governance picture by providing the operational processes needed to maintain compliance in real-world scenarios.

Let's begin by exploring compliance management in Nirmata Control Hub.
