Policy exceptions are temporary deviations that are required when following the policy practices might not be possible because it can hinder operational needs.

### Policy exception workflow

Every policy exception request is sent to an admin for review. The admin can either accept or reject the request. If the request gets accepted, the PolicyException resource gets deployed and the user who requested the exception gets notified via email.

1. Go to **Policy** -> **PolicyReports**. Click on the namespaces to view the violations in that namespace.
2. Click on the violation that needs an exception. This will display a detailed report of that particular violation.
3. On the same page, click on the `Request Policy Exception` button located on the top right-hand section of the screen. It will display a dialog box as shown below.
